# React üòé + Tailwind üí® Project Starter Template 
Use until create-react-app doesn't support PostCSS 8.

## How to use?
$git clone https://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@github.com/openchain123/OpenchainTestVersion.git`
$yarn install
    If you have not yarn installed, please run 'npm install yarn' before run 'yarn install'
$npm run build
$npm start

## Why did I make this?
I was using Tailwind with react a lot and felt the whole process of setting up tailwind every time quite the fuss.  

#### Why the fuss?
Create React App doesn't support PostCSS 8 yet so you need to install the Tailwind CSS v2.0 PostCSS 7. Also since Create React App doesn't let you override the PostCSS configuration natively, CRACO is used.
